  subheading: Seaweed provides a sustainable and regenerative platform to address
    CO2 sequestration, pollution and volatility from our climate emergency. Our
    systems-level approach means that every part of our operation - from
    collection to distribution -  is geared at restoring vital ecosystems and
    supporting resilient circular economies.

      heading: Leathers & Non-wovens
      subheading: We’re creating a plant-based fabric that  relies on the extraction
        of structural polymers to form films stronger than the seaweed itself
        and competitive with the strength of other vegan textiles, without
        relying  on polyurethane (PU) plastic for structure and strength.

      heading: SeaBalance Emulsifiers
      subheading: "Our SeaBalance line of broad-spectrum emulsifiers have a wide range
        of applications across cosmetics and skin-care products. They’re truly
        natural: unlike emulsifiers used in cosmetics and personal health that
        are often made with harmful fossil fuel derivatives. SeaBalance solves
        this by utilizing an all-natural process to make an emulsifier that’s
        healthy to use, and healthy for the planet.   C-Combinator emulsifiers
        are versatile by nature: they work with formulations ranging from pH 3.5
        to pH 9, and are capable of emulsifying a wide variety of oils between
        10% to 40% oil content.  "
