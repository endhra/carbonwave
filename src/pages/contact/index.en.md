    - heading: Cataño, Puerto Rico
      subheading: Puerto Rico (Borikén) is the HQ for our research laboratory and our
        biorefinery, the central processing point for seaweed collected
        throughout the Caribbean. This beautiful island has a long history of
        world-class biotech innovation, as well as community-led approaches to
        climate resilience and adaptation.

    - heading: Puerto Morelos, México
      subheading: The coast of Quintana Roo (Ekab) in the Yucatán Peninsula is where
        most of the Sargassum blooms in the Caribbean accumulate. For that
        reason, it's where we are piloting innovative and
        environmentally-friendly processes to harvest Sargassum. Mexico, one of
        the top agricultural producers in the world, is also where we are
        developing our range of land-restoring and crop-optimizing natural
        agricultural technologies.
