  heading: We’re the world’s leading developer of ultra-regenerative, plant-based,
    advanced biomaterials from seaweed
  subheading: Sargassum doesn’t need land or other inputs to grow, making it an
    ultra-regenerative and adaptive plant-based resource. Our proprietary
    approach turns Sargassum - long considered waste - into materials that can
    restore soils and oceans, eliminate micro-plastic waste, and achieve carbon
    neutrality.

  heading: Our oceans are out of balance, exhausted by CO2, heat, and waste
  subheading: Deforestation & water pollution have significantly increased
    nutrient runoff. In combination with warming oceans, it’s created the
    perfect conditions for seaweed blooms suffocating coastal ecosystems and
    disrupting communities and livelihoods. In the Atlantic and Caribbean, this
    has prompted the biggest seaweed boom in history.

  heading: Seaweed will power new ways of restoring balance to lands and oceans in
    the road to decarbonize our economies
  subheading: Humanity generates more CO2 than the planet can handle, much of it
    already captured by oceans. A rise of 2,000 ppm by about 2240 (IPCC
    worst-case scenario) implies a civilization-threatening temperature rise of
    9 degrees c (16F).
  counter_date: Today
  counter_text: All latest data is reported as the number of molecules of carbon
    dioxide divided by the number of all molecules in air carbon, measured at
    Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii.

      heading: Restore natural carbon sinks
      subheading: Our integrated approach to regenerate soils and oceans aims to
        strengthen their natural ability as Carbon Sinks – all the while
        restoring their capacity to generate life – as critical habitats,
        fishing grounds, or farmland.

      heading: Create new Carbon capture, usage, and storage (CCUS)
      subheading: The ocean is essential for reaching net-zero. By using seaweed, the
        fastest growing biomass on the planet, we are creating ways to achieve a
        new path to Gigaton-scale carbon capture.

      heading: Offer a path away from oil & toxic raw materials
      subheading: Our materials not only replace toxic, petroleum-based products, but
        also create next-generation alternatives - from fertilizers to
        cosmetics, clothing to packaging - that improve on industry standards
        while reducing emissions.

  heading: Rethinking economies through pioneering plant-based science
  subheading: We’re one of the few global companies exploring the benefits of
    brown seaweed, and the only one with an integrated mass collection network
    and cascading processing operation ready to address the Sargassum emergency.
    This means scalable systems capable of supplying to a global economy with
    measurable positive environmental impact.

  heading: Global transformation starts with local adaptation
  subheading: By creating a circular economy that turns Sargassum from harmful
    waste to materials and products for local use, we are solving a key
    environmental catastrophe affecting communities from West Africa to the
    Caribbean in a truly sustainable way. This is specially relevant as tropical
    and subtropical nations – specially islands and coastal states – are
    particularly vulnerable to climate-related volatility and resource
    dependence.
