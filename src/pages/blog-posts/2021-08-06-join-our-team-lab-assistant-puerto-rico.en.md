We're looking for a Lab Assistant 

Come join the C-Combinator team to sustain a livable planet through seaweed products. We are looking for a lab assistant who can help us create biomaterials, including plastics, films and absorbers, from seaweed-derived inputs to improve agriculture, nurture human health and improve the lives of local communities. Lab work will involve exploring ways to develop new materials from our sustainable seaweed extracts and helping the team develop commercial manufacturing processes to make a difference at scale.

We are looking for a motivated teammate who wants to join a diverse, highly collaborative, creative, and supportive team. A base understanding of a related scientific discipline (biochemistry, chemical engineering, materials science) is important.  We are all willing to experiment, learn, and help each other as we develop new ways of processing seaweed into high value products.
