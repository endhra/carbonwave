C-Combinator is proud to announce an unique collaboration agreement with [Chapingo University](https://www.chapingo.mx/), Mexico's premier university for agricultural sciences and one of the top field studies colleges in Latin America. As part of this collaboration, Chapingo will certify C-Combinator products like our biostimulants and fertilizers under the Sarga Agrisciences brand, C-Combinator's division for agricultural products.

Mexico is the seventh largest food exporter and is within the top 15 agricultural producers in the world, making this partnership timely and critical.

Chapingo Dean, Dr. José Solís Ramírez, remarked: “\[The Use of Sargassum] will allow - in addition to impacting the yield and production in the field, cleaning the beaches of Quintana Roo and Yucatán, helping tourist services and local economies recove - us as an institution to reaffirm the commitment to preserve the natural resources that represent the enormous beauty that we have as a nation ”.

Jon Wettack, director of Mexico and Caribbean Operations of C-combinator, stated that one of the objectives of the company is to replace toxic chemicals with organic agricultural inputs: “The association with the Universidad Autónoma Chapingo will allow us to perfect natural and organic products, and take advantage of the world-class agricultural experience that the team of this educational institution has to develop organic fertilizers and improve fields and soils for the benefit of the agricultural sector."

As of 2021, Chapingo works across a wide field of agricultural departments: General Agriculture , Forestry, Agricultural Economics, Phytotechnics, Agricultural Industries, Irrigation, Agricultural Parasitology, Rural Sociology, Soil Studies, Aridity and Desertification Studies, and Zootechnics.
