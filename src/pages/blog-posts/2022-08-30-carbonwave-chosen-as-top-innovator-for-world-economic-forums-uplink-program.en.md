We are thrilled to share that we're part of the winning cohort of the UpLink - World Economic Forum 's Coastal Tourism Challenge.

Through Grupo ENSOL Caribe, our sustainable Sargassum collection group, we're working with hotels, resorts, local associations and governments to protect the pristine and coral-rich coasts of Quintana Roo in Mexico. And in our labs in Mexico and Puerto Rico, we're turning that into a wide range of plant-based products - like vegan leather alternatives, cosmetic emulsifiers, and agricultural organic fertilizers - that replace toxic products and regenerate ecosystems.
