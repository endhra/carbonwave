Excerpt:

*In this booming algae biomass sector, C-Combinator stands out from the competition in several ways. The global algal biomass industry overwhelmingly draws on cultivated seaweed. Wild seaweed like C-Combinator’s Sargassum is responsible for only a minuscule fraction. “Sargassum is severely underexplored compared to cold-water seaweeds like Kelp. We are the first company to figure out how to make high value products from Sargassum through our proprietary and patented processes.”*

*C-Combinator also bucks industry trends through its “cascading” manufacturing model. Jason explains what this means: “each step or sequence creates a valuable product. So, besides our current product line, we are also developing additional products in biofuels, chemical inputs and agriculture. Our cascading biorefinery models means our whole process is sequentially designed to get the most value from the seaweed possible, in both monetary and environmental aspects, while minimising costs and waste.”*
